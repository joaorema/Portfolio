📖 About The Project

This portfolio serves as a central hub for my work, experience, and technical writing. It was built to demonstrate clean architecture, component reusability, and responsive design principles.

Unlike standard templates, this project implements a Dockerized development environment to ensure consistency across different machines and deployments.

 Key Features

 Mobile-First Design: Fully responsive layouts using Tailwind's utility classes.

 Blazing Fast: Powered by Vite for instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized builds.

 Type Safety: Written in TypeScript to catch errors at compile time.

 Containerized: Includes a Dockerfile and docker-compose for consistent deployment.

 Interactive UI: Smooth animations using Framer Motion and CSS transitions.
